# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [`zsh`](http://www.zsh.org/) (v5.2 or recent) must be installed.
- [Powerline Font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) must be installed and used in your terminal (for example, switch font to [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)).

## Installing

Now that the requirements are satisfied, you can install Spaceship via any of the following tools.

=== "oh-my-zsh"

    Clone this repo:

    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt" --depth=1
    ```


    Symlink `spaceship.zsh-theme` to your oh-my-zsh custom themes directory:

    ```zsh
    ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme"
    ```


    Set `ZSH_THEME="spaceship"` in your `.zshrc`.

=== "npm"

    ```
    npm install -g spaceship-prompt
    ```


    Done. This command should link `spaceship.zsh` as `prompt_spaceship_setup` to your `$fpath` and set `prompt spaceship` in `.zshrc`. Just reload your terminal.
    
    **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Update Spaceship to new versions as you would any other package.

=== "prezto"

    - Follow [prezto-contrib#usage](https://github.com/belak/prezto-contrib#usage) to clone `prezto-contrib` to the proper location.
    - Enable the `contrib-prompt` module (before the `prompt` module).
    - Set `zstyle ':prezto:module:prompt' theme 'spaceship'` in your `.zpreztorc`.

=== "zim"

    Add `zmodule denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt --name spaceship` to your `.zimrc` and run `zimfw install`.

=== "antigen"

    Add the following snippet in your `.zshrc`:

    ```
    antigen theme denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt
    ```

=== "antibody"

    Update your `.zshrc` file with the following line:

    ```
    antibody bundle denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt
    ```

=== "zinit"

    Add the following line to your `.zshrc` where you're adding your other Zsh plugins:

    ```
    zinit light denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt
    ```

=== "zgen"

    Add the following line to your `.zshrc` where you're adding your other Zsh plugins:

    ```
    zgen load denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt spaceship
    ```

=== "zplug"

    Use this command in your `.zshrc` to load Spaceship as prompt theme:

    ```
    zplug "denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt", use:spaceship.zsh, from:github, as:theme
    ```

=== "Arch"

    Install the latest master from the AUR package [`spaceship-prompt-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spaceship-prompt-git/):

    ```
    git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/spaceship-prompt-git.git --depth=1
    cd spaceship-prompt-git
    makepkg -si
    ```

### Manual

If you have problems with approaches above, follow these instructions:

- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git --depth=1`
- Symlink `spaceship.zsh` to somewhere in [`$fpath`](http://www.refining-linux.org/archives/46/ZSH-Gem-12-Autoloading-functions/) as `prompt_spaceship_setup`.
- Initialize prompt system and choose `spaceship`.

#### Example

Run `echo $fpath` to see possible location and link `spaceship.zsh` there, like:

```zsh
$ ln -sf "$PWD/spaceship.zsh" "/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/prompt_spaceship_setup"
```

For a user-specific installation, simply add a directory to `$fpath` for that user in `.zshrc`:

```zsh
fpath=( "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zfunctions" $fpath )
```

Then install the theme like this:

```zsh
$ ln -sf "$PWD/spaceship.zsh" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zfunctions/prompt_spaceship_setup"
```

For initializing prompt system add this to your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
# .zshrc
autoload -U promptinit; promptinit
prompt spaceship
```
